# react-conditional-renderer
This repository contains a React component that handles conditional rendering using if-else statements. As of now, it supports only if-else conditions for rendering components. Future updates will include additional control structures such as loops and switch cases to enhance its functionality.

Key Features
 - Conditional Rendering: Utilizes if-else statements to conditionally render components based on specified conditions.  
 - Future Enhancements: Planned updates to include loops and switch cases for more complex conditional rendering scenarios.

Feel free to contribute and suggest improvements!
